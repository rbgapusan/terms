# Terms and Conditions Made Easy

Reading legal documents on websites or any webpage, for that matter, is considered a chore by many people.

When somebody wants to use the services of a website, most people just assume that the document must be good for both the user and the website owner because many people have already signed up.


# Tools, resources used

This project uses a free Bootstrap template (Corlate - http://shapebootstrap.net/item/corlate-free-responsive-business-html-template/) for the demo.

The jQuery Text Zoom (http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Plugin-For-On-Page-Text-Control-Plugin-Text-Zoom/examples/) for the text zoom in/out.

Sample generic website terms and conditions (http://www.freenetlaw.com/free-website-terms-and-conditions/website-terms-and-conditions.doc).

This page (http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/) is the reason for some of the features implemented in this project.


# How to view the test page

On any html page, go to the bottom of the page. Click on the link to Terms and Conditions.

On the Terms and Conditions page, click on the link to the View User-Friendly Version. Test it out :)


# Dev comments

The project will be converted to a jQuery plugin when enough features have been added. 

The input of the planned plugin is a HTML div that contains the Terms and Conditions (or other legal documents, or any document/text for that matter).

The input HTML needs to be on a certain format for the plugin to generate the correct output. More on this later...
